## About
An Android application which allows the user to construct, insert into, remove from, and visualize a binary tree data structure which contains integer values from 0-999. Balancing of type AVL or Red-Black may be toggled. Upon change of balance type, the tree is retroactively balanced as necessary. More unique to this app, the user-interface experience is intended to be very strong, featuring zoom-in, zoom-out, pan, and tap-selection.

## Features
* Balancing of tree may be toggled
* User may zoom-in, zoom-out, and pan the visualization
* User may increase line width and node spacing as necessary
* User may click on a node to select it
* User may select which theme tree should have
* Extremely large trees may be visualized
