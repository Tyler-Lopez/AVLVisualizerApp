# About
An Android application which allows the user to construct, insert into, remove from, and visualize the binary tree data structure containing integer values from 0-999; heavy emphasis is placed on material design (attractive theming) and user interface (node tap-selection + zoom-in and zoom-out). Balancing of type AVL or Red-Black may be toggled.

## Features
* Balancing of tree may be toggled
* User may zoom-in, zoom-out, and pan the visualization
